/ Lord Maleificus was the hero of DaeZig. If it hadn't been for him appearing,
DaeZig would still be a failed state teetering on the brink of collapse. He is
seen as a harsh man...but DaeZig needed a harsh man to make up for years of
cowering in a corner. Maleificus, your deeds were noble. /

He Was A Man

We Now Hold Dear
He Opened The Door
And Fired The Gun
Hail To The Great Zae
Hail To The Great Zae

/ note: "Ison" means "Person from Without" in Carsiekan. This song uses the
word in the FinalZig context, where it translates to "Infidel" rather than
"Foreigner" as it would in the Carsiekan context. "That Damned Ison" refers to
a generic person who disagrees with Valstrazian Ziggist thought, specifically
with the notion of cyber states. /
